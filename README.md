<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This is a simple Discord Bot built by 2 Students of the University of Bonn.
The Bot can do many things: starting from simple greetings and telling jokes, 
to setting timers, making polls and even joining you on a voice channel. 

### Built With

The Main Libraries we used for this Application are: 
* [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
* [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer)
* [Reflections](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections)


## Getting Started

Here we will explain how to get this Bot up and running.

### Prerequisites

* _Java 8 or later_

  Make sure to have Java 8 or later installed. However, the current version is recommended. 
* _IDE_

    You will need an IDE to be able to start your bot. We would recommend IntelliJ IDEA.
* _Discord Account_ 

    Logically, you will also need a discord account in order to run your bot 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krristi427/DiscordBot.git your_directory
   ```
   
2. Create a new Application under ```https://discord.com/developers/applications```. Copy the token from there
3. Open ```resources/config.properties``` and replace the token there with one of your own. 
4. Run the Application

Bear in mind that the prefix is ```%```. You can change that in the same file, just watch out that the new prefix 
doesn't match the prefix of another bot on your server.
